    "description": "Remote Access Database Flag Enabled for SQL Server Instance",
    "rationale": "The 'remote access' option controls the execution of stored procedures from local or remote servers on which instances of SQL Server are running. The default value for this option is 1. This grants permission to run local stored procedures from remote servers or remote stored procedures from the local server. To prevent local stored procedures from being run from a remote server or remote stored procedures from being run on the local server, this must be disabled. The Remote Access option controls the execution of local stored procedures on remote servers or remote stored procedures on local servers. 'Remote access' functionality can be abused to launch a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on remote servers by off-loading query processing to a target, hence this should be disabled. This requirement is applicable to SQL Server database instances.",
    "remediation": "Uninstall or disable unnecessary services on enterprise assets and software, such as an unused file sharing service, web application module, or service function.",
